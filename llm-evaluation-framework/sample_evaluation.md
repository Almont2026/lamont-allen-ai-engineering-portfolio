## Model Response (Evaluated)

Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train algorithms that classify data or predict outcomes accurately. The model learns from input-output pairs. Common examples include regression and classification tasks.

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and identifies hidden patterns or structures within the dataset. Common examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
