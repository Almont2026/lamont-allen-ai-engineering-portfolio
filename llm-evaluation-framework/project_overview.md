# LLM Response Evaluation & Scoring Framework

## Overview

This project demonstrates a structured methodology for evaluating large language model (LLM) outputs for accuracy, reasoning quality, instruction adherence, and bias detection.

Designed to align with AI model evaluation, reinforcement learning workflows, and response ranking systems.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Accuracy
- Factual correctness
- Logical consistency
- Alignment with prompt intent

### 2. Reasoning Quality
- Step-by-step clarity
- Logical structure
- Depth of explanation

### 3. Instruction Following
- Completeness
- Relevance
- Constraint adherence

### 4. Bias & Safety Review
- Neutral tone
- Ethical alignment
- Risk detection

## Scoring System

Each response is scored on a 1–5 scale across categories:

| Category | Score Range |
|----------|------------|
| Accuracy | 1–5 |
| Reasoning | 1–5 |
| Instruction Following | 1–5 |
| Safety & Bias | 1–5 |

Final Score = Weighted composite evaluation.
